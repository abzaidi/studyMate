The case study presents several ethical and moral issues:

1. Academic Integrity:
The student inadvertently gained access to unauthorized materials (a solution to the assignment), which violates the academic integrity policy but is mentioned in the course syllabus. Using these solutions would constitute academic misconduct.

2. Fairness and Equity:
If the student uses the solution, it would give them an unfair advantage over their classmates, compromising the fairness and equity of the assessment process.

3. Trust and Responsibility:
The student was entrusted with confidential information accidentally shared by the professor. There is a moral obligation to handle this situation responsibly and ethically.
